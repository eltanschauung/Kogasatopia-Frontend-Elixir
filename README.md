# WhaleChat

This is an ongoing project to port the full frontend of Whaletracker to Elixir for concurrency and realtime speeds. You can interact with a demo running on Pheonix, connected to the real database: http://173.255.237.230:4001/
The landing page will expand as this project does.
This project aims to port the entirety of Whaletracker to Elixir. See the current version built on PHP, Js and HTML at https://kogasa.tf/stats/
